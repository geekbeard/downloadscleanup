# Downloads Cleanup Script
Show your downloads folder who's the boss!

## What is this and why?

This is just a supidest, simplest batch script for Windows. Why? Oh I'll tell you why. Do you download THINGS from the internet? Like, files, you know? Like - MANY OF THEM? Where do they end up? Well, if you are someone with a little bit of sense or order you at least keep them in the Downloads folder. If you just put them all over the place - there is no hope for you. Leave this page. Move on with your life. Nothing will save you. Otherwise continue reading.

You download and download and download... Which leads to your Downloads folder with time becoming a big pile of burning tires. Which still grows though. Yeah, Yeah, ok, you will go and you will empty it from time to time. But who has the time for this janitorial duties? Yes, exactly - no one!

INTRODUCING ---> BATCH SCRIPT! Supporting AI since 1981 (it can do IF statements, so good enough for AI).

This batch script will do the cleanup of old downloads for you.

## How it works?

When it runs, it will collect folders and files from the Downloads folder, check how old are they and depending on the cut off time (number of days after which the item is considered old) will delete folders and files.

## How to use it? 

Just put it somewhere safe, like Documents folder or something. Then you should create a Scheduled Task, make it run Daily.

In the script see the comments if you want to adjust the number of days and put the correct path to the downloads folder.
